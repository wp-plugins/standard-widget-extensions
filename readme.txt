This plugin adds some nice features to your standard widgets.

== Description ==

Standard Widget Extensions is extension for WordPress standard themes, Twenty Thirteen/Twenty Twelve/Twenty Eleven/Twenty Ten.
It's also effective for themes which use widgets in a standard manner.

Current version of the plugin offers following two features.
You can individually turn on and off these features.

1. Accordion Widgets

Twenty Twelve/Twenty Eleven users can use this plugin out of the box.
Twenty Thirteen users have to need [some work to use it](http://en.hetarena.com/archives/207 "some work to use it").
Other theme users can adjust class names and/or IDs to suit the theme.
You can find options for the plugin by selecting a menu 'Settings' - 'Standard WE'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Sidebar drops to the bottom while resizing =
The sidebar width is fixed when you load the page if you enable sticky widget feature. 
Due to technical reason, it's not dynamically changed. 
So you may need reloading the page to get proper layout after resizing.

= IE7 seems to forget widget accordion status =
IE7 cannot memory widget accordion status. So all widgets are initially collapsed just after loading pages.

= IE6 seems blah, blah, blah.... =
Please tell your audience to upgrade browser.
