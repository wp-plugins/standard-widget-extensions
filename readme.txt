== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Sidebar drops to the bottom while resizing =
The sidebar width is fixed when you load the page if you enable sticky widget feature. 
Due to technical reason, it's not dynamically changed. 
So you may need reloading the page to get proper layout after resizing.

= IE7 seems to forget widget accordion status =
IE7 cannot memory widget accordion status. So all widgets are initially collapsed just after loading pages.

= IE6 seems blah, blah, blah.... =
Please tell your audience to upgrade browser.
